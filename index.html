                <p><strong>Before we start,</strong> first of all, I want to apologize. I know I said I would make an edit, but I have no experience in it, and I need more time. Well, it's a work in progress, you see.</p>
                
                <p>And this is not a letter—consider this a <em>trailer</em> for a letter.</p>
                
                <p>There are so many things I want to tell you, but words always fall short. No matter how much I text, it never feels enough.</p>
                
                <p>But let's start from the beginning.</p>
                
                <p>I saw a reel that said, <em>"I would cry if someone wrote me 10 reasons why they love me."</em></p>
                
                <p>Well, I can't write 10 reasons why I love you, but I can write 10 reasons why I like you.</p>
                
                <p>I'm not good with writing, so sorry if I say something dumb. I know this isn't a good gift, but still… here it goes.and i want this to be special so dont share it to anyone only me and you </p>
                
                <h3>10 Reasons Why I Like You:</h3>
                
                <p><strong>1.</strong> First, it's just how you are. I don't know why, but in school, I always thought that you were sweet. Probably that's why I had a crush on you. I thought this crush thing wouldn't last long, but it did. And when we started talking—well, you know, I used to get jealous when you talked about your college crush. (I know I'm not your boyfriend, but still… )</p>
                
                <p><strong>2.</strong> Those eyes of yours—you see, I used to wonder why people always say eyes are magical. I thought they were dumb for saying that. But even when I'm looking at yours through a mobile screen, they are… I don't even know how to explain it. Like I'm stuck. I look at them at the start of the day and at the end of the day.</p>
                
                <p><strong>3.</strong> You see, I like your laugh. I know I've only heard it over the phone, but I'm sure it's even better in real life.</p>
                
                <p><strong>4.</strong> Your hair—I haven't seen it in person, but I just know it shines under the moonlight, like something out of a dream.</p>
                
                <p><strong>5.</strong> The way you talk—I love hearing your voice. Please call me more. Even the simplest words from you sound special.</p>
                
                <p><strong>6.</strong> The way you make me feel—it's something I can't put into words. No matter how my day is going, just talking to you makes everything better.</p>
                
                <p><strong>7.</strong> Those cute photos of yours and the adorable faces you make you look really, <em>really</em> cute in them. </p>
                
                <p><strong>8.</strong> No matter what I do, you randomly pop up in my mind—even when I'm not trying to think about you. Like that one time I was in an exam, and all I could think about was you… and not just that, even in my <em>dreamsssss</em> omg. </p>
                
                <p><strong>9.</strong> The way you make everything feel special. Even the most random conversations or the simplest call with you feel different like they actually make me feel like everything is okayyyy.</p>
                
                <p><strong>10.</strong> Simply put, <em>you</em>. Everything about you. I don't even need a reason—it's just you, and that's enoughhh. </p>
                
                <p>Even 10 reasons aren't enough. I might just end up writing a whole book just for you. </p>
